\begin_layout Abstract
As robots become increasingly prevalent in social or work environments with
 humans, there is a need to understand human-robot interaction (HRI) to
 build strong and effective relationships.
 There are several aspects of HRI and the focus of this paper will be the
 relationship between path planning and proxemics, or social distance, which
 is the comfortable, physical distance between two parties.
 This project investigates the effects of proxemic models on two path planning
 techniques, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 and artificial potential field (APF), by simulating an autonomous robot
 navigating in the presence of crew members in a space station module.
 We evaluated the results of these two factors over twelve cases of goal
 and crew positions.
 The introduction of proxemic models tended to help APF avoid local minima
 but increased the computational load for

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Technological advances in robotics are leading towards increased prevalence
 of robots within society, ranging from existing roles as work partners
 (e.g.
 space exploration, military, search and rescue) to social ones (e.g.
 healthcare, companionship).
 NASA is developing and deploying robots, such as Robonaut, Astrobee, Valkyrie,
 and SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental
 Satellites), to work with and/or in the same environment as astronauts.
 Robots like Astrobee will perform tedious, daily monitoring tasks and will
 need to navigate the modules in the ISS (International Space Station) without
 adversely affecting crew (a.k.a.
 astronaut) activities.
 Therefore, these monitoring robots will need to understand and adhere to
 rules governing personal and work space.
 The aim of this simulation project is to leverage an existing personal
 space model and investigate its effect on path planning (i.e.
 human-aware navigation) of an autonomous robot, like Astrobee.
 While our interest focuses on space exploration, human-aware navigation
 can be applied across a variety of contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human-aware navigation has drawn on Human-Human Interaction (HHI) proxemics
 research, established by Edward T.
 Hall in the 1960s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Proxemics is the study of human use of space, and provides a framework
 for understanding the comfortable, physical distance between two parties.
 The application of proxemics to Human-Robot Interation (HRI) has been a
 recent topic of research.
 Proxemics is rapidly becoming a relevant topic for autonomous robotics
 and path planning to account for human comfort in a shared environment.
 Kruse et.
 al conducted a human-aware navigation literature search that revealed increasin
g publications and interest since 2001 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This relatively novel field contains many unanswered questions, but has
 produced generalized observations across the literature that humans tend
 to interact with robots as if they were humans.

The SPHERES platform is a system of three free-flying small satellites that
 have been operating out of the Japanese Experimental Module of the ISS
 since 2006.
 First developed as a class project at MIT, the platform, through its ability
 to upload guest software, has become a primary source of research in autonomous
 controls for free-flying spacecraft.
 For example, this satellite research platform enabled the development of
 a safe and stable cold-gas CO

 propulsion system.
 After the development of the capability for the satellites to use smartphone
 technology for experiments in 2011, the new Smart SPHERES’ telerobotic
 capabilities allowed for the rapid advancement of autonomous relative navigatio

In its current projection, Astrobee will operate only semi-autonomously
 in coordination with the ground crew.
 Given a goal, Astrobee will follow a pre-programmed path using its computer
 vision navigation system.
 When Astrobee encounters an obstacle it will slow down, stop, and wait
 for either a ground controller to telenavigate Astrobee around the obstacle
 or for the obstacle to leave its preplanned path (See Figure

Astrobee would clearly benefit from fully autonomous, human-aware navigation.
 With its primary purpose to help crew while working in the same environment,
 human-aware navigation is the logical development path.
 Astrobee is also an ideal candidate for robotics simulation research, prior
 to physical testing.
 As Astrobee interacts directly with crew and life support systems, it is
 subject to the stringent safety measures applied to any ISS payload
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Rigorous testing through robotics simulation, rather than immediately switching
 to the physical world, provides an opportunity for risk-free development.
 With Astrobee’s evolutionary history, established technologies, and intended
 application, it lends itself perfectly to our research simulation that
 will focus on one aspect of human-aware navigation: proxemics.

 In a study by Kim and Mutlu, proxemic distance (physical distance), is
 examined in conjunction with task distance (collaborative versus competitive)
 and power distance (supervisor versus subordinate)

 In a card matching task, participants performed better with a greater physical
 distance (120 cm versus 46 cm) and reported a more positive experience
 with a subordinate robot when it kept a greater physical distance

.
 While most of the HHI-based hypotheses found support, some have no support
 and may be an indication that humans interact differently with robots in
 certain contexts.
 However, the experimental design may not have used a complicated enough
 task, particularly for examining power distance and the benefits of a collabora
tive relationship may have been lost.
 For our purposes, the results of the study indicate that a subordinate
 robot, like Astrobee, should tend to maintain a farther distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other studies have examined the approach of a robot to a human or vice versa,
 and measured the minimum resulting distance where the participants felt
 comfortable.
 Torta et al.
 varied the approach angle (0˚ or head-on to 70˚) and the body position
 of the participant (sitting versus standing) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "torta2013design"

\end_inset

.
 Overall, participants reported a preference for a head-on approach, a rightward
 versus leftward, and the proxemic distance was larger than that measured
 in HHI 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "torta2013design"

\end_inset

.
 Proxemic distance changed for sitting participants, where the preferred
 distance increased from side to center (i.e.
 minimum proxemic distance at 70˚) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "torta2013design"

\end_inset

.
 The authors suggested that the robot's height, which is relatively short,
 may have caused the deviation from HHI distances.
 Another study investigated the change in proxemic distance with repeated
 interactions between the human and the robot, and hypothesized that exposure
 over multiple weeks would continuously decrease the proxemic distance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "walters2011long"

\end_inset

 While the distance did decrease, the adaptation occurred in the first two
 sessions, remained constant for the following four weeks, and were comparable
 with HHI distances 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Another study sought to examine the effect of personal experience on the
 proxemics distance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Here, personal experience and participants with agreeable personalities
 had smaller minimum proxemic distances.
 Interestingly, there was a gender effect when the robot gazed at the participan
ts’ faces, where it resulted in a shorter distance for men and a greater
 distance for women 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In most of these studies, preference and proxemic distance were considered.
 A preference does not necessarily translate into a shorter proxemic distance,
 as seen where a head-on approach is the most preferred and results in the
 greatest proxemic distance

 Kirby et.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some proxemic distance factors are more relevant for the application of
 an autonomous robot onboard the ISS.
 The robot would take on a subordinate position, would not gaze, have a
 collaborative-type task, have a long-term relationship, and could approach
 from multiple directions in 3D space.
 Based on the literature review to date, the robot should maintain a farther
 distance and approach from certain directions (center, then right, then
 left).
 What is currently unclear is how the mapping of proxemics distance, such
 as in a cost-based model, would translate to 3D space.
 This question would be of significant relevance to understand human-aware
 navigation onboard the ISS.
 While an interesting question, it would not be appropriate to tackle in
 this project due to time constraints and the experimental setup (simulation),
 so it must be left to future researchers.

Heuristic Graph Search For Path Planning 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 graph search method, introduced by Hart in 1968, uses a heuristic cost
 approximation to find optimal paths between nodes on a graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hart1968formal"

\end_inset

.
 For navigational applications of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

, positions in the environment are discretized and mapped to nodes on a
 graph, with connections to the neighboring positions.
 Nodes can be traversed by taking an action with an associated cost.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 algorithm uses a heuristic search technique to find an optimal set of actions
 to move from the starting node to the goal node.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 is not well suited for real-time navigation because it does not incorporate
 dynamics of the robot or its environment and may not be able to replan
 quickly.
 Additionally on physical systems, paths generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 would need to be tracked using a lower-level controller.
 Variations on 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 and other algorithms based on similar principles have been used to address
 some of those challenges (Refer to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kirby2009companion,stentz1994d,koenig2004lifelong"

 is still considered a standard technique for path planning.

 proposed a path planning scheme called COMPANION, which uses a modified
 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 graph search based algorithm with a proxemic cost function.
 Kirby et.al showed that a heuristic path-planning algorithm could demonstrate
 social behaviors, such as passing on one side and respecting personal space.
 We adopted the encoding strategy for desired behaviors (respecting human
 proxemics, minimizing distance to a goal, and minimizing the time taken
 to reach a goal) into a weighted

 heuristic function, as outlined in

Artificial Potential Field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Artificial Potential Field (APF) method for robot navigation was introduced
 by Khatib in the 1980's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "khatib1986real"

\end_inset

.
 APF is a reactive navigation method that models the robot as a particle
 driven by a potential field.
 In APF, a potential field is mapped onto the environment based on the position
 of goals and obstacles.
 Goals are incorporated as negative (attractive) potentials, while obstacles
 have associated positive (repulsive) potentials.
 Then, the control forces on the robot are set to the modeled force equal
 to the negative gradient of the potential field.
 In this way, the robot drives away from obstacles and towards the goal.
 This method is relatively simple to implement and is well suited for real-time
 navigation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main limitations of APF  come from the locality of the behavior, such
 as becoming trapped in local minima or oscillating near obstacles due to
 local extrema 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "koren1991potential"

\end_inset

.
 The APF method cannot provide any guarantee of global optimality, since
 the control scheme is inherently local.
 In order to address these challenges, one may try to carefully formulate
 the potentials associated with obstacles and goal positions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ge2000new"

\end_inset

.
 Another approach is to incorporate a hierarchical supervisor that switches
 to another navigation method if it detects the APF controller has become
 caught at a local minima, which has the main drawback of added complexity

Problem Formulation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Path planning generally uses either a global, hierarchical search or a local,
 reactive method, such as those described above.
 To incorporate human-aware navigation and increase human comfort, these
 methods are modified to include a proxemic model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kruse2013human"

\end_inset

.
 However, much human-aware path planning is focused on a global, hierarchical
 approach; in the human-aware navigation survey by Kruse et.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

al, reactive methods are not considered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kruse2013human"

\end_inset

.
 We are particularly interested in whether a hierarchical architecture is
 necessary for human-aware path planning, as the literature seems focused
 on global search methods.
 To that end, we have explored the question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\series bold
How do the output paths of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A^{*}}$
\end_inset

 and APF architectures react to the introduction of proxemics during autonomous
 navigation in an enclosed area? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global search methods can find globally optimal paths, but are often slow
 and require modification to be used for real-time navigation in dynamic
 environments.
 In contrast, reactive methods are simple and well suited to real-time control,
 but may perform non-optimally.
 Most local, reactive techniques are based on APF, which may cause the robot
 to stop moving towards the target due to local minima in the potential
 field.
 Overweighted obstacles can also overwhelm the attraction to the target
 and cause navigational errors.
 For both path planning methods, we compared the robot's trajectory with
 and without a proxemic model.
 In APF, soft constraints were used to avoid collisions with the crew and
 the environment's walls.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

, we used hard constraints to avoid collisions with both the wall and crew
 members, although approaching humans remains a soft constraint given by
 the cost function model.

In the interest of focusing our investigation, we have intentionally limited
 the scope of our simulation.
 We developed a two-dimensional simulation with a simplifeid dynamical represent

 boundaries.
 Although this makes the simulation more abstract, it allows us to focus
 on the effect of the introduction of proxemic models on the path planning
 methods.

 The dynamics model only holonomic translation with the assumption that

 We treated the propulsion and battery lifetimes as irrelevant.
 We also did not include sensor limitations and control uncertainties.
 Our path planning algorithms use perfect knowledge of the environment,
 including location and orientation of crew.
 The results are also evaluated under perfect control, so given a path,
 the robot could follow it perfectly.

 In order for simulation results to be directly applied to a physical situation
 involving Astrobee, these limitations would need to be included in a final
 simulation.
 However, thanks to Astrobee's payload ports for additional software and
 the demonstrated feasibility of computer vision-based navigation for satellites
 on the ISS, we shall assume that with additional computer vision software,
 supplementation with other sensors, or an adjustment of velocity, Astrobee
 could have all needed information available to it at all times and execute
 its desired performance admirably.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to address the research question, we created 12 cases using multiple
 factors with the aim of creating challenging navigational situations to
 draw out differences bewteen proxemic and non-proxemic models for APF and
 A*.
 The first factor, the mission type, defined the navigational goal(s) of
 the robot and were selected to cause the robot to transverse through the
 space in different ways.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Illustration-of-paths"

\end_inset

, there are three possible mission types: Direct, Waypoints, and Monitoring.
 The second factor, the crew configuration, defined how the module space
 was occupied with four possible options:1 Crew, 2 Crew, Clustered Crew,
 and Random Crew (See Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:configurations"

\end_inset

).
 The 1 Crew configuration placed the crew facing in the direction of the
 robot starting point.
 The 2 Crew configuration was situated to potentially cause an occlusion
 by placing two crew members facing and opposing each other.
 The Clustered Crew was configured to create a higher density of obstacles
 for that location.
 Finally, the position and orientation of the Random Crew was randomly generated
 to create an unknown situation.
 The third factor was the use of a non-proxemic or proxemic model for the
 crew potential fields or cost function.
 The fourth factor was the implementation of APF or A*.
 Due to the large number of simulations, it was helpful to define the terms

 and

 for this paper.
 A case was described by the mission type and crew configuration, and there
 were a total of 12 possibilities.
 A scenario was identified by the case and the model, which yielded 24 scenarios
 or test scenarios.
 The implementation of APF and A* are applied for each scenario for a total
 of 48 simulations.
 The results and analysis are reported by APF scenarios (24) and A* scenarios
 (24).

\begin_layout Subsection
Artificial Potential Field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our APF implementation, the robot was modelled as a particle driven by
 a potential field.
 Potential fields are linear, so the total potential at each point is is
 the sum of the different components
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\left(x_{r},y_{y}\right)=\sum U_{i}\left(x_{r},y_{y}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and the force acting on the robot was the partial derivative of the potential
 field with respect to each direction, with the addition of a damping term:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
F_{x} & =\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{r}}U\left(x_{r},y_{y}\right)-bv_{x}\\
F_{y} & =\frac{\partial}{\partial y_{r}}U\left(x_{r},y_{y}\right)-bv_{y}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

If the magnitude of these control forces exceeded the maximum thrust of
 Astrobee, they were scaled so that the controlled force magnitude would
 be within the thrust constraint, but direction remained unchanged.
 The motion of robot was then determined by the dynamic and kinematic constraint
s for two dimensions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}v_{x} & =\frac{1}{m}F_{x}\\
\frac{d}{dt}v_{y} & =\frac{1}{m}F_{y}\\
\frac{d}{dt}x_{r} & =v_{x}\\
\frac{d}{dt}y_{r} & =v_{y}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

In many APF simulations, damping in the overall system is included in the
 dynamic model of the mobile robot, caused by losses such as friction.
 We chose to consider the damping as a tunable parameter in the scheme navigatio
n for two reasons.
 Firstly, we did not have a good model for the drag Astrobee would encounter
 while moving in the module, making it difficult to justify the choice of
 a parameter.
 Secondly, since Astrobee was travelling only at low velocities, additional
 damping in the navigation system may have been needed to achieve a desirable
 performance, so we could consider the the total damping as a design parameter.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{r}$
\end_inset

 were the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 coordinates of the robot, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and

 were the width and height of the module, and

 was a width normalizing constant set to 0.15, so that the potential drops
 off to 1% of the peak value 1.5 robot lengths from a wall.

The attractive potential field associated with the goal position was a combinati
on conic and quadratic potential, two common goal models used in APF, defined
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{\text{goal}}\left(x_{r},y_{r}\right)=\begin{cases}
-kd^{2} & \text{ if }d<1.5l\\
-k\left(1.5l+d\right) & \text{ if }d\ge1.5l
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d=\sqrt{\left(x_{r}-x_{g}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{r}-y_{g}\right)^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 was the distance between the robot and the goal and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 was the side length of the robot.
 This potential acted as a spring force on the robot when the robot was
 close to the goal and as a constant attractive force when the robot was
 far away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose the values for the constants 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 by qualitatively evaluating the performance of APF for the for the first
 case over a range of values.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $k=\unit[1]{N/m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\unit[5]{N\cdot s/m}$
\end_inset

 were chosen because the robot moved the fastest (25 cm/s) without driving
 through the repulsive potential associated with the crew.
 These parameters were kept constant over the course of our simulations
 to enable comparison between case studies.
 This velocity, 25 cm/s, was considered comfortable in the proxemic literature.
 These results indicated that the forces associated with moving toward the
 goal, avoiding collisions with humans, and damping were acceptably tuned.
 However, this search was non-exhaustive and there may exist values which
 produce better path planning performance.
 We recommended that further parameter trials be performed before extending
 the research presented in this paper.

 Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 technique is a modification of Dijkstra's algorithm to find a lowest-cost
 path between two points on a directed graph, but it uses an additional
 heuristic to perform not just a breadth-first search, but a best-first
 search.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our general algorithm was implemented using a priority queue of potential
 paths, stored as lists of graph nodes, each with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 coordinates and an associated velocity.
 As the algorithm planned our robot's path through a discretized map of
 the module, it considered all eight possible nearest neighbors on the grid,
 with a range of possible next velocities at each location, assigning each
 possible next step a cost that depends on the relative position of the
 crew and the robot's location and velocity.
 After the cost was calculated for each newest node in a path, each new
 path was added to the priority queue with a priority equal to the sum of
 the cumalative cost and a heuristic value.
 The heuristic is a function of location and velocity that estimates the
 cost  of the current path based on path length and velocity.
 The heuristic used in our simulations is described below
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
in Section 4.2.1
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Once each new potential path was added to the priority queue, the algorithm
 then selected the path with the lowest priority from the current queue,
 and it repeated the same process to extend the newly selected path.
 The algorithm returned a path when the edge of the robot reached a distance
 of 1.2 times the grid step size, which allowed the algorithm to recognize
 when the robot had reached its destination, still allowing for some flexibility
 in position and continuing inertia.

\begin_inset Formula $D$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We selected our heuristic to emphasize following the shortest path to the
 goal and travelling at a higher velocity, desirable traits that would allow
 the robot to prioritize efficient use of fuel, power, and time.
 Both quantities were weighted with coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 following the manner found in Kirby's COMPANION algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, which allowed us to control the strength with which these priorities competed
 with the proxemic cost function, which was considered to have a weight
 of 1.
 The weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 were chosen in the same manner as parameter selection in the APF case,
 where we compared several parameter values of the simplest mission/crew
 combination.
 Based on this comparison, we qualitatively selected the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0.05$
\end_inset

 to use for our simulation.
 While more rigorous testing of weights is recommended for further studies,
 our method of selection was deemed sufficient given the time limitations
 and scope of our study; since the parameters were kept constant for all
 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$

 scenarios, we expect the values do not have a significant influence on
 the effect of using the different human avoidance models.

The path extension step was implemented through consideration of the eight
 nearest nodes with varying velocities, described below.
 Each path kept a list of nodes that had already been visited on the path,
 and only added nodes that hadn't been visited on the way to the current
 waypoint, in order to avoid pointless loops that would slow the algorithm.
 Viability of nodes also considered potential robot collisions.
 Hard constraints ceased considering potential nodes that would cause the
 robot to collide with a human obstacle or the module wall, with a collision
 being defined as within a distance of the robot's working radius of the
 coordinates of the wall or the human's defined area.
 For collision detection, we used the robot's working radius, defined as
 the distance from the center of the robot to a corner of the robot, or
 8.49 We introduced a hard constraint for walls that prevents our Astrobee
 model from coming into physical contact with the module's walls unless
 directed to do so as part of its task
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each step, the possible velocities for consideration were determined
 by the robot's inertia, maximum thrust, mass, and our hard-coded safety
 constraints, which limited the maximum robot velocity to 0.5m/s at all times
 to ensure crew comfort and spacecraft safety.
 Given a current velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}$
\end_inset

, possible velocities were determined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{new}=\sqrt{{v_{0}^{2}\pm2\frac{T_{max}}{m}s}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{max}$
\end_inset

 is astrobee's maximum thrust, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is astrobee's mass, and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the distance between the current node and the neighboring node under
 consideration.
 Using our rectangular grid, 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 took on only two possible values: 
\begin_inset Formula $s=6.72"$
\end_inset

 for next nodes parallel to the module walls, or 
\begin_inset Formula $s=9.50"$
\end_inset

 for diagonal next nodes.
 Our considered velocity range was then determined by 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{max}=min(Absolute\ max\ velocity,Max\ possible\ velocity)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{min}=max(0,Min\ possible\ velocity)$
\end_inset

, and five velocities (limited to mitigate the time taken for the code to
 run), equally spaced within that range, were considered at each viable
 next node.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we added a constraint that allowed Astrobee to slow to a stop at
 each waypoint, rather than barrelling into a wall.
 If Astrobee's working radius was inside the range at which Astrobee would
 need to use constant, maximum thrust to slow to a stop by the waypoint,
 Astrobee's maximum velocity for the next step was capped at a speed of
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{max}=\sqrt{2as}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 was Astrobee's current distance from the waypoint.

 The shape factors

 were based on rotational transformations of the aligned shape factors,

b & =\frac{\sin2\theta}{4\sigma_{p}^{2}}-\frac{\sin2\theta}{4\sigma_{s}^{2}}\\
c & =\frac{\sin^{2}\theta}{2\sigma_{p}^{2}}+\frac{\cos^{2}\theta}{2\sigma_{s}^{2}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 was the orientation of the crew member in the global frame of reference.
 The values for aligned shape factors were described by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{h} & =\max\left[2\left|v\right|,0.5\right]\\
\sigma_{s} & =\frac{2}{3}\sigma_{h}\\
\sigma_{r} & =\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{h}\\
\sigma_{p} & =\begin{cases}
\sigma_{h} & \text{ if robot in front of crew}\\
\sigma_{r} & \text{ if robot behind crew}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

We note that the larger shape factor in the front of the crew corresponded
 to a wider cost curve, reflecting the need for more personal space in the
 forward direction.
 The smaller shape factor for the rear reflected the need for less personal
 space.

Results & Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of the results was separated by path planning algorithm and
 focused on the comparision between the non-proxemic and proxemic model,
 as the aim of the analysis was the ascertain the effects of a proxemic
 model on path planning.
 The metrics used for the analysis consisted of goals attained, distance
 traveled, average velocity, maximum velocity, minimum distance, completion
 time, collisions, and personal space zones.
 The minimum distance refers to the smallest distance between the robot
 and a crew member for the duration of a simulation.
 For multiple crew members, the smallest distance overall was used.
 The completion time is the total time of the simulation, and the robot
 does not have the navigate to every goal zone for the simulation to cease.
 The simulation may have ended when all goals were attained, the robot was
 entrapped in a local minimum (APF), or the computational times exceeded
 the limits (A*).
 The collisions metric will not be further discussed, as there were no collision
s across 48 simulations.
 Finally, the definitions of the personal space zone used as shown in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 For all 48 scenarios, the robot never entered the close intimate or intimate
 zones.

 was calculated and values within 5% were not considered adequate to draw
 strong conclusions.
 Additionally, cases were separated from the main analysis and addressed
 individually when the robots' paths between non-proxemic and proxemic scenarios
 were significantly different and a direct, high-level comparision may not
 be appropriate.
 This seperation was done to direct a more focused analysis on those unique
 cases.

 It should be noted that in the implementation of APF, the robot was programmed

 Consequently, the robot would not be able to reach a goal zone if it encoutered
 a local minimum elsewhere.
 Entrapment in local minima affected multple scenarios and will be discussed

Incomplete Missions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of 24 scenarios, the robot was unable to reach one goal in 6 test scenarios
 (4 non-proxemic, 2 proxemic) due to entrapment in local minima.
 The configuration of the clustered crew in Case 7 blocks the robot's access
 to Goal 2 for both the non-proxemic and proxemic scenarios
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Similarly, Crew 1 in Case 12 creates a local minimum that prevents the
 robot from continuing to Goal 4 for both non-proxemic and proxemic scenarios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Distance Traveled and Average Velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 11 cases, the distanced traveled was similar between non-proxemic and
 proxemic scenarios.
 The in the distance traveled from non-proxemic to proxemic across scenarios
 is less than or equal to 2.99%.
 The average velocity was also largely consisent between non-proxemic and
 proxemic scenarios.
 In 9 cases, the average velocity was within 5% of the non-proxemic value,
 and ranged between 2.50 cm/s and 8.87 cm/s across scenarios.
 In Case 7, the proxemic scenario saw an increased average velocity (78.19%
 change or +2.09 cm/s) and a larger maximum velocity (7.22% change or +1.94
 cm/s) resulting in a faster completion time (-44.49% change or -194.75 s).
 While navigating towards Goal 2, the robot appeared to translate slowly
 across the clustered crew before reaching a local minimum and continuing
 to the next goal zone.
 This process occured earlier and was of shorter duration in the proxemic
 scenario

Maximum Velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-proxemic and proxemic cases, the maximum velocity tended to reach
 similar values (within 3.58% of non-proxemic value) ranging between 18.38
 cm/s and 26.76 cm/s.
 There were three cases where a larger change in maximum velocity from non-proxe
mic occured (7.22% to 18.02% change) (Cases 10, 11, 12).
 In the 12 scenarios where the maximum velocity was greater than 25 cm/s,
 the widths of the Gaussian distributions describing the obstacles (a.k.a.
 crew) would have increased, resulting in a dynamically changing field during
 navigation to a goal zone.
 The results also confirm that the maximum velocity never exceeded the 50
 cm/s constraint for any scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Personal Space Zones and Minimum Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The change in minimum distance for four cases was within 0.28%, where in
 three of the cases (Cases 2, 3, 9) the robot's trajectory was relatively
 far from the crew members and it would be expected that the proxemic cost
 function would have an minimal effect.
 For these cases, the minimum crew distance was greater than 1.2 m and in
 the social zone.
 The robots' paths depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Case-12-Comparison"

\end_inset

 for Case 12 illustrate areas where the proxemic model effect varies, where
 the paths overlap through Goal 2 (small proxemic effect) and separate at
 Goal 3 (larger proxemic effect) .
 These results highlight that inclusion of a proxemic model has a smaller
 effect at large distances from crew.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis also showed that a proxemic model robot maintained a smaller
 minimum distance from crew than a non-proxemic one by 6.49% to 14.72%.
 In Case 4, the maximum velocity does not exceed 25 cm/s for either scenario.
 As a result, the robot with the proxemic model passes crew from behind
 and on the side and the shape factor in these cases are smaller than for
 the non-proxemic one
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A similar situation occurs in Case 8, where the proxemic model robot passes
 closer to Crew 1 and 2, which are oriented away from the robot.
 Again this situation is repeated for Case 10 and 11, where the robot passes
 behind and with velocities less than 25 cm/s.
 Therefore, the overall orientation of the crew is an important factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In two cases, the proxemic scenario yielded a larger minimum distance.
 The first case (Case 5), the robot passes in front of the crew member.
 Since passing in front is a higher shape factor, the proxemic model maintains
 a larger distance from the crew, as expected.
 The robot also approaches a cluster of crew and crosses in front in Case
 7.
 The proxemic model produced expected results with the robot maintaining
 a larger distance 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

.
 These results compliment the recently discussed findings, where the crew
 orientation is an important factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were surprisingly few differences throughout the scenarios regarding
 personal space zones, and the differences ranged from 0% to 1.15% across
 9 cases.
 In Case 7, the non-proxemic model robot spent signficantly longer transversing
 the space in front of the clustered crew and at a closer distance.
 Consequently, the robot stayed longer in the personal zones for Crew 1,
 2, and 3 by 236.75 s, 194.00 s, 183.00 s, respectively.
 Overall, the non-proxemic and proxemic models behaved similarly in terms
 of personal space zones

Unique Cases

\begin_layout Standard
In Case 1, the non-proxemic model robot encountered a local minimum in front
 of the crew and was unable to navigate around the crew member.
 In the proxemic scenario, the robot was able to pass by the crew member
 and complete the simulation.
 The maximum velocity of the proxemic model robot was 23.00 cm/s, so the
 potential field was static for the duration of the simulation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar situation occured during the Case 6, where in the non-proxemic
 scenario the robot was unable to reach the goal zone.
 In comparing the potential fields when the robot navigates to Goal 2, a
 local minimum occurs just outside of Goal 2 in the non-proxemic scenario.
 However, in the proxemic case, the local minimum occurs just inside the
 goal zone boundary.
 As a result, the non-proxemic model robot crossed in front of Crew 2, whereas
 the proxemic model robot continued behind Crew 1.
 While the proxemic model robot was able to reach Goal 2, it caused the
 average velocity to decrease (-46.66% change from non-proxemic) due to a
 large amount of time spent at a low force and velocity near Crew 1 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fig ref
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This area in the field appears to be the driver behind the increased completion
 time for the proxemic scenario (82.00%).
 Passing behind Crew 1 also brings the proxemic model robot closer, decreasing
 the minimum distance by 8.00%.
 The increased distance traveled by the non-proxemic robot is attributed
 to when it double backs after reaching the local minimum (-2.99% change
 from proxemic).
 In terms of personal space zones, the robots from both scenarios entered
 the personal zone for Crew 1.
 Due to the non-proxemic model robot crossing in front, it spends time in
 the personal zone of Crew 2.
 In contrast, the proxemic model robot never enters the personal zone of
 that crew member

Incomplete Missions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The robot was unable to navigation to all goal zones successfully in 10
 scenarios (6 non-proxemic, 4 proxemic), and the success rate ranged from
 0% to 80%.
 In some cases, both the non-proxemic and proxemic scenarios failed to reach
 every goal zone.
 In Case 7, three crew members were situated in front of the second goal.
 For both non-proxemic and proxemic scenarios, the robot decreased its velocity
 as it approached the clustered crew, was not able to navigate to Goal 2,
 and the simulation ended.
 Similarly, Case 12 fails in the same manner for the non-proxemic and proxemic
 scenarios.
 The robot is able to reach Goal 3 and has to navigate towards a cluster
 of two crew members facing the robot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Distance Traveled and Average Velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all cases the average velocity was lower for proxemic scenarios (35.89
 cm/s to 49.03 cm/s) than non-proxemic ones (45.52 cm/s to 49.27 cm/s), but
 the change in distance traveled did not have a consistent trend.
 The distance traveled increased for the Case 3 and Case 5, where in the
 former case the robot is perturbed from the module centerline in the proxemic
 scenario and for the latter case the robot maintains a farther distance
 from the crew when crossing in front.
 In other cases, the proxemic scenario had a smaller average velocity and
 shorter distance traveled than the non-proxemic one.
 The first case (Case 4) has a relatively small difference of 8.28%.
 The robot appears to stay closer to the centerline and Crew 2 near Goal
 2 for the proxemic case.
 Even though the quantity of direction changes in similar (36 for non-proxemic
 and 35 for proxemic), the robot in the non-proxemic case travels a shorter
 distance before changing direction with a higher average velocity, which
 may explain the increased overal distance and shorter completion time 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Another case (Case 7) follows a similar pattern with a smaller average
 velocity and distance traveled for the proxemic scenario with the key differenc
e that the simulation ended before reaching Goal 2.
 As expected, the robot maintains a farther distance from the clustered
 crew causing the shorter distance traveled.
 The simulations for Case 12 also ended before reaching the goal (Goal 4).
 The robot approaches closer to the crew clustered by the Goal 3 for the
 non-proxemic case.
 Compared to other cases, the percent change in average velocity for this
 case was relatively small (6.67%) and the decreased velocity for the proxemic
 scenario appears to be attributed to the effect of Crew 2 and 3 by Goal
 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, there were two cases where the distance traveled was within
 0.57% between the applicable non-proxemic scenarios.
 For Case 8, the closest crew members to the robot's trajectory are approximatel
y facing 180 degrees away.
 Therefore, the robot in the proxemic scenario primarily experienced the
 shape factor from sigma_r

 For Case 9, the crew is positioned in the module center while the robot
 navigates around the perimeter.
 It appears at this distance that inclusion of the proxemic model does not
 affect the results, as every comparision metric is within 4.76% of the non-proxe
mic scenario.

Maximum Velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Across the 24 scenarios, the maximum allowable velocity was achieved for
 23 scenarios.
 During Case 4, the proxemic scenario had a maximum velocity of 49.14 cm/s.
 This maximum velocity resulted from the tradeoff between the time penalty
 and velocity-dependent cost function.
 The shortest path to the goal zone would bring the robot close to crew
 members (i.e.
 higher cost area).
 Therefore, the robot's trajectory expanded outwards from the crew members
 to minimize the cost and time.
 As a result, the average velocity and completion time for the nonproxemic
 scenario were 24.50% lower and 33.86% slower than the proxemic one, respectively.
 Interestingly, the distance traveled in the proxemic case actually decreased
 by 8.28%.

Personal Space Zones and Minimum Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of cases saw a greater than 5% change from the non-proxemic
 scenario minimum distance.
 There were three cases (Cases 3, 4, 9) where the percent change ranged
 from 0% to 4.76%, and can be attributed to either a large distance from
 crew (Case 3, 9) or favorable crew orientation (Case 4).
 All these explanations converge on the situation where the proxemic cost
 function is less and closer in value to the non-proxemic one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where the robot's trajectory brought it in front of crew, the minimum
 distance for the non-proxemic scenario was smaller, as it could approach
 closer to the crew due to the decreased width of the cost function.
 This result occured for Case 5, 7, and 12, where the percent change was
 13.99%, 19.42% and 36.41%.
 However, the robot occupied the same personal space zones–personal, social,
 and public–for both scenarios and the time spent in the personal zone did
 not appear significantly different.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Cases 3, 5, 7, and 8, the proxemic model robot traveled slower past
 nearby crew members causing increased time in particular zones–typically
 in the closest zone the robot ever crossed for that case.
 For example, the robot in Case 5 crossed in front of a crew member at velocitie
s less than 25 cm/s (compared to upwards of 50 cm/s for non-proxemic) and
 had increased time in the personal zone.
 In contrast, the proxemic model robot's path by Crew 4 in Case 4 expands
 outward (see 
\begin_inset Note Note

) and the robot never enters the personal zone, whereas the non-proxemic
 model robot does.

 of time spent in each personal space zone

Unique Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the A* simulations, several cases were identified as unique due to the
 significantly different robot paths between the non-proxemic and proxemic
 scenarios.
 In all of these cases (Case 1, 2, 6, 10, 11), the number of goals reached
 is different for the proxemic and non-proxemic scenarios.
 Since the level of completion has a strong effect on the metrics, it does
 not seem reasonable to draw any conclusions along those lines.
 In some cases, the non-proxemic model robot is not able to reach all the
 goals (Case 1 = 0%, Case 6 = 25%, Case 10 = 20%) and the proxemic model
 robot can complete the mission

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The reverse ocurred in Case 2, and the proxemic model robot did not reach
 any goals (0%) and the non-proxemic model robot completed the mission.
 Lastly, both robots did not reach all goals in Case 11 to varying degrees
 (non-proxemic = 20%, proxemic = 60%).
 It is interesting to observe that the non-proxemic model robot reached
 less of the goals than the proxemic model one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the non-proxemic Case 1, the robot started to navigate around the crew
 in the same direction as the proxemic scenario, but was unable to continue
 past a few steps.
 Similarily, in Case 6 the simulation times out for the non-proxemic case
 and the proxemic scenario is able to complete.
 Interestingly, the robot reaches the same coordinates and distance from
 Crew 1 en route to Goal 2 for both scenarios in this case.
 At that location, the standard deviation for the non-proxemic and proxemic
 cost functions would be 0.36m and 0.50 m, respectively.
 Yet, the robot has more difficulty navigating around a cost function with
 a smaller width and the cause is unclear.
 For the Case 10, the robot stops 0.72 m away from Crew 2 between Goal 1
 and 2 for the non-proxemic scenario.
 In the proxemic scenario, the robot moves closer to the wall earlier (x
 = 1.76 m and t = 7.90 s versus x = 3.04 m and t = 10.46 for non-proxemic) and
 is able to reach all goal zones.
 Also, the width of the cost function is smaller behind the crew (sigma_r

\end_inset

 approximately 0.25 m while passing) than than non-proxemic width enabling
 the robot to pass in this simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite case occured for Case 2, where the robot completed the non-proxemic
 scenario and not the proxemic one.
 In the proxemic scenario, the robot approached the two crew with the maximum
 allowed velocity (50 cm/s) and started to decrease its velocity at t =
 5.66 s to less than 25 cm/s resulting in the minimum possible crew cost
 functions.
 The relevant portion of the crew cost functions defined by the asymmetrical
 Gaussian distribution is sigma_h = 0.5m 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since the distance between the crew centers is 2.44 m, the crew are facing
 each other, and the value of a Gaussian distribution is essentially zero
 after three standard deviations away from the mean (> 1.5 m), the cost functions
 overlap and may cause an occlusion .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case 11, the non-proxemic and proxemic scenarios appear to fail in different
 ways.
 For the non-proxemic scenario, the robot is unable to pass behind Crew
 4 like Case 10, and fails at a similar location and time.
 This finding is consistent between Case 10 and 11, implying that a robot
 cannot pass behind a crew member facing towards the center of the module
 and 3 ft.
 away from the wall using a non-proxemic model.
 While in the proxemic scenario, the robot is able to navigate behind a
 single crew member positioned close to the wall, the robot cannot pass
 behind the cluster.
 Crew 3 is oriented so that the robot would have to pass through multiple
 cost functions

To move to discussion: The cause of the increased computational times in
 unclear and would be a point for future investigation.
 The grid size and computational times were partially investigated, but
 it was out of the scope of this project to allocated enough resources for

\begin_layout Subsection
Evaluation of Results 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the studies we reviewed, none closely matched our experimental design
 of comparing proxemic and nonproxemic navigational methods for different
 architectures (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Comparison-of-HRI"

\end_inset

), therefore they cannot provide a direct comparison.
 The primary point of comparison between previous studies described in the
 literature review and our proposed one will be the instantaneous distance
 between the robot and the human.
 There are references (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) and studies (

key "kirby2009companion,takayama2009influences,walters2011long,torta2013design,kim2014social"

\end_inset

) documenting the proxemic distance across multiple factors.
 It is not possible to include many factors, in particular those pertaining
 to humans (e.g.
 height, pet experience), in this simulation, but it may be possible to
 make recommendations or pose questions for further investigation.
 Hypothetically, if one architecture plans a path that tends to be closer
 to humans, that architecture may be more suitable when the humans have
 a smaller proxemic distance (e.g.
 prior experience with pets

\end_inset

).
 Even though this simulation did not accomodate feedback regarding human
 acceptance of the robot, it may provide still valuable insights through
 comparison with other human studies.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we found that in most situations, APF did not have significant
 differences in the paths generated using the proxemic and non-proxemic
 models.
 However, there were a small number of cases where the proxemic model helped
 avoid the common APF problem of getting stuck in a local minima when the
 goal was on the opposite side of the robot.
 In mission 1, crew configuration 1, the APF was able to navigate around
 the crew member directly in between the robot starting position and the
 goal position.
 This case was likely caused by a combination of the shallow gradient in
 the potential field associated with the asymetric gaussian and numerical
 round-off.
 For a shallow gradient, the numerical round-off acts to introduces noise,
 helping push the robot out of the local minima.
 In contrast, the ability of the APF method to navigate around the crew
 in mission 2, crew configuration 2 is a direct result of the proxemic model
 driving the robot around the back of the crew member.
 By incorporating this social behavior, the APF method avoids the problem
 of local minima in some cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our implementation of APF and 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

, we also found that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 was able to plan paths that used much higher velocities.
 Since the proxemic model of human avoidance is dependent on velocity, we
 noticed more that the paths generated tended to plan paths with greater
 distances from the crew so that the path could continue moving at the higher
 velocity without incurring additional cost.
 It is possible that by tuning APF so that it could achieve higher velocities,
 we could see similar increased distances maintained from the crew using
 the proxemic model.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

's weights could also be tuned to produce differing results in terms of
 maximum velocities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For computational time, our 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 implementation included a time-out if the computations seemed to be taking
 too long.
 This restriction also reflects patience and timing requirements for use
 on an actual robot, and the feasibility of using 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a scenario with humans, where movement and obstacles are likely to change
 in unpredictable ways.
 We notice that many cases that would cause APF to become stuck in a local
 minima or to travel excessively slowly due to the shallow gradient, were
 also cases where the computational time for the 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 algorithm took longer than the cutoffs we enforced.
 In paths where this was not an issue, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 actually returned an optimal path quite quickly.
 Although as a global search algorithm, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 should be able to find the optimal path for any crew and mission combination
 given enough computational time, our results suggest that challenges for
 using such a method for real-time navigation are actually quite analagous.
 We note that the real-time navigation method proposed by Kirby adds some
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 by using a variable-sized grid; this may not be so different from adding
 some global behavior to a local method, as is often done with APF.
 In addition, the runtime of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 is extremely dependent on the implementation of its data structures .
 Due to the increase in computational grid size due to cost depending on
 differences in velocities, we made the decision that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 should only calculate costs as it approached each node.
 In situations in which the path is less simple, and 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 searches a large proportion of the graph, the computational time could
 benefit from pre-computing costs.
 While this choice seems the most obvious change, there are certainly other
 optimizations that could allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 to begin to run in real time, and the algorithm should not be written off
 for future studies.

Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the literature review to date, a consistent and obvious avenue
 for future work was apparent: incorporation of physiological signals for
 real-time feedback of proxemics distance.
 Currently, experimental setups with physical robots and humans rely on
 questionnaires (e.g.
 Likert scales) after the human-robot encounter, and pose several limitations.
 Post-experimental questionnaires are dependent on accurate recollection,
 and in this context, cannot be used real-time.
 It may be possible in an experiment to have a human indicate discomfort
 by pressing a button, but this would not be desirable in an applied setting
 where robots should not increase any burden.
 Therefore, it would be desirable to translate physiological signals (measured
 in a way that is not invasive) to emotional states, primarily discomfort.
 Chandler briefly reviewed various options, where the galvanic skin response
 and facial expression reading appear the most promising

 Research in affect recognition has sought to evaluate classifier accuracy

 As an alternative to physiological signals, Best et.
 al describe the use of a machine learning algorithm to discern the likely
 social signal (e.g.
 angry) from social cues, such as head movement and gait 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "best2016clustering"

.
 Social cues may be interesting to investigate as another input source,
 but the classification accuracy was lower as several social cues appeared
 across social signals.
 Physiological signals appears better suited for the next step in this research
 to achieve the desired application.
 Incorporation of physiological signals will require collaboration across
 disciplines, like physiology and machine learning, and is expected to improve
 HRI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important direction for future work in human-aware navigation in
 the context of space travel is the extension of current proxemic models
 to three dimensions.
 Most human-robot proxemic research has used robots that travel on the ground
 on earth, so proximity has been limited to two dimensions.
 Work has been done showing how the height of the robot changes the reported
 comfortable distance.
 However, it is not clear if or how this would translate to a small robot
 approaching from different directions.
 It would be interesting to see compare the proxemic models in three dimensions
 changes for flying robots on earth to floating robots in space.
 It is worth noting that the number of people who might interact with a
 robot in space is limited, and factors that affect proxemic distance may
 be more homogenous than in the general population (such as experience with
 robots).
 Long term space travel would also provide a valuable opportunity to see
 how comfort changes over time.
 It is also worth noting that with an additional 3 degrees of freedom, the
 computational complexity of the human 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maze
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the algorithms must traverse would increase significantly, which could
 have dramatic effects on computational time and new complications for local
 minima.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We treated our study as a proof-of-concept, so that we could be certain
 that our results were caused by the introduction of proxemics into our
 otherwise identical case studies.
 Such simplifications have removed many variables that could have unknown
 results, and we acknowledge that further improvements, including z-varying
 proxemics, three additional degrees of freedom in our simulated robot movement,
 sensor limitations, and a more complex environment, would need to be made
 before any results could be applied to a practical situation or tested
 in a changing environment.
 Now that we have established a baseline study with proxemics alone, it
 will be possible for future simulations to expand on the work done here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To properly provide conclusions a solution applicable to the ISS, the additional
 degrees of freedom and asymmetry that come with a microgravity environment
 mean that we cannot ignore the effect of the system's 3-dimensionality
 on our path planning algorithms.
 Considering a human model as a cylinder, the associated proxemics would
 vary with z-position 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kirby2009companion"

\end_inset

.
 While we can ignore this variation as irrelevant in a 2D simulation (We
 are treating all human obstacles as if at a uniform height), it would prove
 an inaccurate representation of a 3D world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More work could also be done to explore our specific research question about
 the effect of proxemic models on path planning.
 First, we recommend optimizing the 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 implementation to see if the computational issues are relieved.
 If so, then further comparison could be made over a wider range of crew
 and mission configurations.
 It would also be interesting to consider the effect of proxemic on hybrid
 navigation methods.
 For example, we compare some of the 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 variations for real-time navigation like COMPANION and some APF controllers
 that incorporate hierarchical switching to avoid local minima.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we note that before implementation on Astrobee, significant validation
 in high fidelity simulation would be needed to validate both the control
 and path planning.
 As discussed, many simplifying assumpeitons were used in the simulation
 model to allow us to focus on the research question.
 In terms of the simulation, extension to three dimensions, a more accurate
 model of the robot, including anisotropic dynamics and constraints, and
 more realistic models of the module, including cluttered environment.
 In terms of the path planning algorithm, it would be important to incorporate
 models for detecting the environment (including crew position and orientation)
 using vision, which would introduce noise and error.
 In addition, it could introduce a new layer of complexity to model motion
 prediction of humans, particularly taking into account demonstrated human
 tendencies to modify one's own movement in response to an approaching robot
